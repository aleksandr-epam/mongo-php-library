type: mixed
description: |
  Enables users to specify an arbitrary comment to help trace the operation through
  the database profiler, currentOp and logs. The default is to not send a value.

  The comment can be any valid BSON type for server versions 4.4 and above.
  Server versions prior to 4.4 only support string as comment,
  and providing a non-string type will result in a server-side error.
