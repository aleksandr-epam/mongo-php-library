  Enables users to specify an arbitrary comment to help trace the operation through
  the database profiler, currentOp and logs. The default is to not send a value.

  The comment can be any valid BSON type for server versions 4.4 and above.
  Server versions prior to 4.4 do not support comment for write operations,
  and providing one will result in a server-side error.
