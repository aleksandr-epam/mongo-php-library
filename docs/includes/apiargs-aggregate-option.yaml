arg_name: option
name: comment
type: mixed
description: |
  Enables users to specify an arbitrary comment to help trace the operation through
  the database profiler, currentOp and logs. The default is to not send a value.

  The comment can be any valid BSON type for server versions 4.4 and above.
  Server versions between 3.6 and 4.2 only support string as comment,
  and providing a non-string type will result in a server-side error.
  Older server versions do not support comment for aggregate command at all,
  and providing one will result in a server-side error.
